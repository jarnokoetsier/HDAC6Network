## [Extract HDAC6 protein interactions from the literature](https://github.com/jarnokoetsier/HDAC6Network/tree/main/ExtractInteractions)
The R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service (europepmc R library) was applied to extract HDAC6 interacting proteins from the selected papers.

## [Comparison of the literature-based network with a database-driven PPI network](https://github.com/jarnokoetsier/HDAC6Network/tree/main/ComparisonWithDatabasePPI)
The literature-based network consisting of the retrieved HDAC6 interacting proteins was compared to the database-driven network constructed from the [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/) and [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home) databases.

## [Case studies: map expression data of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease onto the network](https://github.com/jarnokoetsier/HDAC6Network/tree/main/CaseStudies)
The expression data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) were mapped onto the literature-based network to visualize AD- and PD-associated changes in the HDAC6 regulatory network.
