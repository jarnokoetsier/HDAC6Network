the ubiquitin proteasome system is overwhelmed with aggregationprone protein by a process in which small protein aggregates are actively transported on microtubules by a process requiring dynein/dynactin motors (38) and the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 (39).	ubiquitin	HDAC6

To test this, we measured the effect of HDAC6 knockdown on recruitment of Atg8/LC3 to GFP-Htt Q103 inclusion bodies (Fig.	HDAC6	LC3	
Although 92  5.8% of IB in cells treated with control RNAi were clearly labeled with Atg8/LC3 antibody, only 43  9.7% of IBs were Atg-positive following HDAC6 knockdown.	LC3	HDAC6	
Although this model could explain the requirement for HDAC6 in delivery of aggregated proteins to pericentriolar inclusion bodies, it is not at all clear how such a linker function could mediate the recruitment of components of the autophagy or lysosomal apparatus, because these structures are not likely to be modified with ubiquitin.	HDAC6	ubiquitin	
To clarify the mechanism by which HDAC6 mediates recruitment of LC3 to aggresomes, we took advantage of tubacin, a recently described, highly selective inhibitor of HDAC6 catalytic activity (49).	HDAC6	LC3	
These data demonstrate that HDAC6 protein and HDAC6 catalytic function is required for transport of LC3 to the aggresomes.	HDAC6	LC3

HDAC6 is a multidomain protein that possesses a BUZfinger domain, which binds to polyubiquitin chains, and two deacetylase domains interrupted by a motif that binds to cytoplasmic dynein (59, 60).	HDAC6	polyubiquitin	
Because these structures are presumably not conjugated to ubiquitin, how HDAC6 contributes to dynein capture or transport of these organelles remains an interesting but unanswered question.	ubiquitin	HDAC6

Interestingly, the aggresome response was blocked by HDAC6 catalytic mutants and the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA).	HDAC6	TSA	
To examine this, we first treated cells with trichostatin A (TSA) which inhibits three classes of HDACs, or sodium butyrate (NaBu), a broad deacetylase inhibitor which does not affect HDAC6 activity [58].	TSA	HDAC6	
Apart from binding to ubiquitinated proteins, HDAC6 catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from a-tubulin and plays an important role in microtubule-dependent intracellular trafficking [60].	HDAC6	a-tubulin	
(B) Quantification shows that treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor TSA counteracts the recruitment of synphilin-1 into aggresomes mediated by kalirin-7, whereas the broad deacetylase inhibitor NaBu does not exert such an effect.	HDAC6	TSA	
This histone deacetylase has been shown to concentrate in Lewy bodies of PD patients [57] and there is increasing evidence that HDAC6 plays an essential role in aggresome formation via its ubiquitin binding and its deacetylase activity.	HDAC6	ubiquitin	
HDAC6 binds to ubiquitinated proteins, including CFTR [57] and huntingtin [72], through a C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain (ZnF-UBP) and also binds to the dynein motor complex through a segment between two catalytic domains [57] facilitating the transport of cargo proteins by the dynein motor complex towards the minus end of microtubules to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).	HDAC6	huntingtin	
Furthermore, HDAC6 has been shown to mediate the deacetylation of a-tubulin in several studies [60,73-75] and the inhibition of HDAC6 has been proposed to regulate the dynamics of the microtubule network [76].	HDAC6	a-tubulin	
Here, we observed that TSA (but not NaBu) as well as a dominant negative HDAC6 mutant conferring loss of catalytic activity counteracted the kalirin-7-mediated recruitment of synphilin-1 aggregates into aggresomes (Figs. 6 and 7).	TSA	HDAC6
